<h1>ðŸ“Š Sales Dashboard using Tableau</h1>

<h2>ðŸŽ¯ Objective</h2>

The objective for developing this Tableau dashboard is to provide to key stakeholders a comprehensive overview of company's business activitities in an easy-to-digest format. It facilitates understanding of trends of various key retail metrics and allows year over year comparison in numerical and graphical formats. I believe that this dashboard can be utilized for both informational purposes and in facilitating well-informed decision-making.     

<h2>ðŸ“‘ Description</h2>

In this project, I built an interactive sales dashboard that allows key stakeholders to view trends of various retail metrics and make a year over year comparison. The built-in controls allow for selecting a year and setting sales target for performance analysis. The dashboard also displays sales by product categories and membership type, as well as top five suppliers manufacturing goods for the company. With just a click, key stakeholders can view details of customer orders and key insights gathered from the data. You can view the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/wholesale-and-retail-orders-dataset).

<h2>ðŸ’¡ Key Findings</h2>

- KPI: As per the KPIs, the company grew sales, profit, number of transactions, and number of goods ordered every year compared to the prior year except in 2020. The financials may have been negatively affected by the impact of COVID-19.
- There is a cyclicality in the sales activity for the business. It experiences highest sales in December, followed by June, July, and August (not in particular order). Slowest months in terms of sales posted are March, September, and October.
- Outdoor goods, sports articles, shoes, clothes, and products related to winter sports generate most sales for the company. It consistently ranks in the top 5 by product categories. 
- Sales from top 5 products account for 75% of overall sales.
- 47% of the goods sold by the company are supplied by 5 out of 65 manufacturers. What's been highlighted on the news regularly since the pandemic? Supply chain diversification and resiliency. The company must identify vulnerabilities in its supply chain and find ways to diversify supply chain and still remain competitive.
- Only 2% of the members are premium members. Adding perks, highlighting membership experience, and increasing promotional budget are options for the company to convert existing members and acquire new customers.
- On average, the delivery time was longest for orders placed by premium members. This may help in explaining the measly number of premium members. What's the point of having a premium membership? Answering the question, why the delivery time is longest for premium members, and addressing it will improve customer experience and boost premium membership count, which in turn increases revenue.
